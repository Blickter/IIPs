## Simple Summary
This updated proposal reflects valuable community feedback and the need to fine-tune the Wave 2 sale for Illuvium Beyond. This adjustment will achieve the ideal balance between cost, scarcity, and fun, while providing a scalable solutions for future Waves.

## Abstract
The Marketing Subcouncil is proposing significant changes to the Wave 2 Illuvitar sale structure. Instead of offering a set quantity of D1SKS for a limited time or until sold out, we propose changing the sale to a 24-hour window with no cap on the quantity offered. We believe this adjustment will not only maintain the desired scarcity of Alphas (1 day vs. 90 days), but also allow demand to scale in line with new player adoption. 

## Rationale
Taking into account the thorough feedback from the community and discussions within the Council, the Marketing SC has reevaluated the initial proposal to better align with the core values of Illuvium Beyond. It is our stance that Illuvium Beyond should be fun, accessible, and supportive of collectors. With a 24-hour window for Alphas, those who wish to collect First Edition Illuvitars have the choice to do so. This allows for the market to determine scarcity. 

In addition to lifting the quantity cap on Alphas, we are proposing pricing adjustment as follows:

Standard D1sks: $5

Mega D1sks: $20

Alpha Standard D1sks: $7.5

Alpha Mega D1sks: $30

## Conclusion
After reviewing community feedback and holding numerous internal discussions, we have revised our proposal with the community, the collector, and the flexâ€™er, each in mind. We still uphold the importance of keeping Alpha Illuvitars as a First Edition product, and believe it's important to offer it as an attainable option for those interested. This structure allows for both scarcity and scalability, and lowers the price barrier to entry, making it easier for newcomers to enter the Illuvium ecosystem. 

Our expectation is that this revised pricing, along with the 24-hr Alpha window, will stimulate early participation in the sale while ensuring that Alphas remain exclusive.
