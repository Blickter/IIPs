## Simple Summary
This proposal adjusts the pricing, tier weights and Alpha sale duration for Illuvium: Beyond. It will also introduce in-game unlocks and monthly raffles as added benefits to Beyond collectors.

## Abstract
Multiple changes are outlined, all with the intent to position Illuvium: Beyond as a product that is accessible to everyone, while retaining the ability for players with more spending power to differentiate themselves. Changes include a 24-hour Alpha sale with unlimited minting, increased drop rates for specific tiers, in-game unlocks and exclusive bonuses, monthly raffles, and revised pricing. Many modifications and additions are discussed in this proposal, rationale will be provided alongside each item to improve clarity.

## Overview
This proposal aims to enhance the sale mechanics, pricing, and drop rates of Illuvitars D1SKS in Illuvium: Beyond. The recommended launch date for Illuvium Wave 2 is August 15, 2023.

## Sale Mechanics

#### Tier Weight Adjustments
To provide a more diverse D1SK opening experience, tier weights for tier 1 will be decreased, while tiers 2-5 will be increased. This adjustment increases the variety of Illuvitar portraits that an average player will reveal, with the intent of mitigating the negative experience of pulling the same low Tier portraits too frequently. Tier weights do need to vary slightly from Wave to Wave to account for the quantity of Illuvials of a given Tier and Stage in the Wave. These weighting adjustments will be communicated prior to each Wave. The proposed baseline weighting will be applied to background weightings and accessory weightings. This change reduces the complexity of the product by having a standardized set of odds across parameters, and provides more diverse outcomes for all elements of D1SK opening.

| Wave 1 Weighting |        | Proposed Baseline Weighting |        |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------|
| Tier             | Weight | Tier                        | Weight |
| 1                | 66.90% | 1                           | 55.70% |
| 2                | 23.30% | 2                           | 28.0%  |
| 3                | 4.80%  | 3                           | 11.0%  |
| 4                | 1.60%  | 4                           | 2.80%  |
| 5                | 0.40%  | 5                           | 0.50%  |
|                  | 100%   |                             | 100%   |


#### Alpha Sale
The Alpha Sale will be a 24 hour event at the start of Waves, with an unlimited supply of Alpha D1SKS. Alpha D1SKS remain a luxury item with no additional power in the Beyond Album, but are priced more moderately than in Wave 1, with a shorter sales window to ensure that anyone who wants to participate in launch events can do so. A shorter Alpha window also means that Marketing efforts can be primarily focused on the start of the Wave.

#### Mega-D1SK Power Threshold
The modification to tier weights alters the outcomes of a 1250 Mega D1SK power threshold, and increases the relative value of Standard D1SKS. To account for these changes, this proposal increases the Mega D1SK power threshold to 1450, which will ensure that the guaranteed power Illuvitar remains a competitive and compelling option for collectors.

## In-game Unlocks
To incentivise collection completion, we introduce in-game unlocks during Wave 2. These soul-bound bonuses exclusively enhance players' accounts, encouraging them to complete collections and display their achievements within the Illuvium universe. These soulbound bonuses provide incentive to complete more granular collections, and provide a collection experience that will resonate with gamers.

## Monthly Raffles
As community events, we will hold monthly raffles accessible to players, fostering excitement and camaraderie within the Illuvium community. These raffles will be conducted three times during the wave, creating additional engagement opportunities.

## Pricing
A price reduction will be applied to Standard and Mega D1SKS, plus an additional reduction to Alpha D1SKS. The reduction of Extended Run D1SK prices is intended to create price points that are more familiar to gamers, and combined with changes to D1SK odds provide a meaningful opportunity to put together smaller collections. 

The price ratio between Standard and Mega D1SKS has been changed from a 1:5 to a 1:6. This decision is based on the intended value for each d1sk type being equal. Wave 1 saw a 2:1 ratio of Standard to Mega D1SKS sold, indicating that players valued Mega D1SKS significantly more than Standard D1SKS. Additionally, offering Standard D1SKS at a $6 price point will allow the DAO to onboard new Beyond players as we consider other product launches.

The final change to pricing is the relative multiplier for Alpha D1SK prices. Alpha Standards are now at a 2x compared to Extended Run, while Alpha Megas are at a 3x compared to Extended Run. Alpha Standards and Alpha Megas sold at approximately a 1:1 ratio during Wave 1. This is believed to be due to the fact that accessories obtained from Alpha D1SKS gain no benefit compared to their non-Alpha counterparts, and that as a premium product, players placed more value on the guaranteed power threshold provided by Mega D1SKS. Alpha Standards have been reduced in price accordingly.

| Type           | ETH Amount | USD Equivalent |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Standard       | 0.003      | 6              |
| Mega           | 0.018      | 36             |
| Alpha Standard | 0.006      | 12             |
| Alpha Mega     | 0.054      | 108            |


## Marketing D1SKS 
5000 Standard D1SKS and 1000 Mega D1SKS will be minted to be used for marketing of Wave 2, and for future events and promotions.

## Rationale
This proposal aims to position Illuvium: Beyond as a product that will hold relevance for everyone engaging in the Illuvium ecosystem. Soulbound collection elements provide gamers with a tangible reason to engage with Beyond. 

It is believed that there is sufficient rarity built into Beyond that there is still room for higher spending players to differentiate themselves through high tier and stage portraits, expressions, backgrounds and finishes. There currently exists a 300k point spread on the leaderboard between 1st and 5th place, indicating that there is plenty of wiggle room to make assets more common without negatively impacting leaderboard competition.

## Risks
It should be noted that much of this proposal is about product positioning, and without A/B testing of price points and other elements, it is not possible to determine an optimal solution based purely on data analysis. Data has been used to inform decisions where applicable.

Adjusting the focus of Illuvium: Beyond to cater to a wider audience carries a risk of reduced DAO revenue for Wave 2. This risk is balanced against the potential for increased engagement, trading volume and ecosystem participation in Wave 2 and into the future.
